/// Keeps the host app alive in the background so the keyboard extension's
/// local bridge poll to `KeyboardLocalServer` always reaches a live process.
/// iOS keeps any app with `UIBackgroundModes = audio` alive while audio is
/// actively being routed; we feed an `AVAudioPlayerNode` a zero-filled
/// looping PCM buffer at 0.001 mixer volume.
///
/// Why `AVAudioEngine` instead of `AVAudioPlayer`:
/// `AVAudioPlayer.play()` returns `false` in practice when the session is
/// transitioning between categories (e.g., right after `AudioRecorder`
/// changed to voice-processing mode and the keeper is asked to resume).
/// `AVAudioPlayerNode` running on an engine is decoupled from session
/// category churn and reliably stays alive across recording sessions.
///
/// Why playback (silent) instead of TypeWhisper's continuous mic engine:
/// playback keeps the app alive without lighting the red microphone status
/// indicator and without actually capturing audio. Battery cost: ~1-2%/hr.
///
/// Critical invariant: the connection format between `player` and
/// `mainMixerNode` MUST match the format of buffers scheduled on the
/// player. A mismatch raises an Obj-C exception that Swift can't catch and
/// crashes the app on launch. We pin both sides to a single static format.
